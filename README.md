# Analysis of CitiBike program, NYC, July - December 2019

## Demographics

### The rate of change of each Gender and Age Range demographic tends to be similar to each other 

#### Gender

While among riders whose gender is known, CitiBike rides are more frequently ridden by by males, when the total overall number of rides increases, the percentage increase of rides for both Male and Female riders tend to be similar. The same is true when the number of rides decline. 

This means when the total number of rides increases, the share of rides taken by Males increases. 

If there is any effort to increase the number of Female riders, the specific efforts should be re evaluated because they do not appear to be effective. The lack of Female ridership may indicate an untapped market for potential future growth. Future marketing efforts can be targeted to potential Female riders by highlighting the benfits that a Female rider may see, and these marketing efforts should be concentrated in mediums in which potential Female riders have a higher likihood of seeing or hearing the advertisement. 

#### Age Range

Similar to the above, among riders whose ages are known, the rate of change for each age group tends to rise and fall at similar rates to eachother. The only exception to this is that CitiBike riders who are teenages was nearly flat the entire period. 


## Extreme Rental Lengths

### Greater than one day

Standard CitiBike rides can last up to 30 minutes, and rides for annual membership holders can last up to 45 minutes without incurring steep additional fees. The additional costs associated with keeping a CitiBike rented for a day without returning it can exceed the annual cost of an 'unlimited' membership, in which a customer can rent a CitiBike as many times as they want 45 minutes at a time. This gives a clear financial incentive for a customer to return their rented bike within 45 minutes, even temporarily if they intend to ride for longer than 45 minutes.
